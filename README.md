# data-visualization2

This project aims to discover insights on consumer behaviour and purchasing trends on an online shopping website using R on the following datasets: [Customer Shopping Trends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset) and [Online Shopping Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksondivakarr/online-shopping-dataset). 

This project was completed as part of the course Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at TU Dublin, Ireland.

The main steps of the R Markdown file are outlined below:

- Loading and cleaning of the datasets
- Exploratory data analysis, using SQl queries for grouping and ggplot for the visuals
- Curation of 3 main visuals providing insights and answering a specific question
